# UML (Unified Modeling Language)

# Memory Management:
- Static Memory Allocation.
- Automatic Memory Allocation.
- Dynamic Memory Allocation.
- Garbage Collection.


# fixed and setpercision(2) used to do string formating:
double d = 5.0/2.0;
cout<<fixed<<setprecision(4)<<d<<endl;


# Implicit/Explicit Conversion:
#Implicit:
- int + short (The program will create automatic casting to the larger one)
- int * double (Automatic casting to double)
- float/double (Automatic casting to double)
#Explicit:
- static_cast<int>(anything)
- static_cast<double>(anything)
- static_cast<char>(anything)

# Random Numbers:
  - Pseudorandom numbers.


# Arrays are actually a pointer to a storage location,
  So, it will be used by reference when we call it to a function.


# Array Sort Types:
- Selection Sort.
- Insertion Sort.
- Bubble Sort.
- Quick Sort.
- Merge Sort.
